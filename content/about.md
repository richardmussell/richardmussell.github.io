**Infrastructure Engineer** specializing in cloud-native systems, container orchestration, and enterprise security. I design and implement scalable infrastructure solutions that balance performance, security, and operational excellence. With hands-on experience across the full stack—from network configuration and system hardening to CI/CD automation and cloud architecture—I bring a comprehensive approach to infrastructure engineering.

My work focuses on applying enterprise-grade practices to build reliable, secure, and maintainable systems. Whether deploying Kubernetes clusters, automating infrastructure with Terraform, or implementing security controls, I prioritize solutions that are production-ready and aligned with industry best practices.
